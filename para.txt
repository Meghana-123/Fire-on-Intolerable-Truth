Each and every women face one or more crimes in each and every stage of her life.
When these activities come to end?
When girl get a freedom to be herself?
when soceity look the girl child similar to a boy baby?
when these rapes get an end?
When will blindfold of justice get open to see the cry of innocent girls?
When will the government takes a strict action on life spoilers?
All these questions are roaming in mind of each and every women of the country. Government has set up some 
acts to push womens in all field but due to family, cruel world, marriage all her rights are blindfolded.
I guess all these questions stay questions if girls don't question it. Yes, all of us 
need to take part in getting Justice to girls, since a girl may be daughter, wife, sister and  mother. Every mother 
had a love towards her family, every daughter has a love towards family, every sister has love towards her family, every
wife has a love towards her family, so Earth is a family we need to respect all womens feelings and to her life.
Each and every day every girl will be dipped in the sour of family and cruel world lets all join our hands
to provide strength to the girl and say that she is not alone the whole world will try to protect every girls life rather than spoiling it.
Then our nation will stand proud. The Government is taking initiative to control violation on women but still it has failed to
stop these atrocities going on in country.
