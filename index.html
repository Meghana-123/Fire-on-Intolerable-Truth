  <h1 class="head">Author's Viewpoint:</h2>
<p class="head">These above mentioned cases are only two but these crimes goes on each and every day in count of
  thousands, every girl is getting punised for half-raw mistakes. Each and every women facing one or more crimes in each and every stage of her life.
When these activities come to end?<br>
When girl get a freedom to be herself in the society?<br>
when soceity look the girl child similar to a boy baby?<br>
when these rapes get an end?<br>
When will blindfold of justice get open to see the cry of innocent girls?<br>
When will the government takes a strict action on life spoilers?<br>
All these questions are roaming in mind of each and every women of the country. Government has set up some
acts to push womens in all field but due to family, cruel world, marriage all her rights are blindfolded.
I guess all these questions stay questions if girls don't question it. Yes, all of us
need to take part in getting Justice to girls. Every mother
has a love towards her family, every daughter has a love towards family, every sister has love towards her family, every
wife has a love towards her family, so Earth is a family we need to respect all womens feelings and to her life.
Each and every day every girl will be dipped in the sour of family and world lets all join our hands
to provide strength to the girl and say that she is not alone the whole world will try to protect every girls life rather than spoiling it.
Then our nation will stand proud. The Government is taking initiative to control violation on women but still it has failed to
stop these atrocities going on in country. These problems are not for this era but it was in exist from many years but still
none of us are ready to question it. It is this mindset that India and the world — sexual violence is rampant in
societies across the world — need to destroy to fight sexual violence. Putting the onus on women to prevent sexual violence
 is not just absurd but dangerous.<br>
Warning girls and women to not go out alone or to dress and behave in a culturally appropriate, male-mandated way
 cannot prevent sexual violence. Rather, we need to din into boys and men (as well as women) that aggression is not
masculinity and being macho is not “cool.” It is only by tackling misogynistic mindsets among men and women and dismantling
 the patriarchal aspects of the people to uphold that sexual violence can be tackle</p>
